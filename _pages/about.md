<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm) (GSAI), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Weiran Shen](https://www.weiran-shen.info/). Before that, I obtained a B.S. degree in Software Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) (HUST).

My research interest lies in the intersection between computer science and economics -- addressing problems with economic motivations through the lens of computer science. Specifically, my research involves the following fields:
- Mechanism design in environments with information asymmetry.
- Learning-based auction design.
